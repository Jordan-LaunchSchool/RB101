# monthly payment in ruby: 
# monthly_payment = loan_amount * (monthly_interest_rate / (1 - (1 + j)**(-loan duration in months)))

# For example, to determine the monthly rate on a $1,200 loan with one year of payments and a 10 percent APR, 
# divide by 12, or 10 รท 12, to arrive at 0.0083 percent as the monthly rate.
